1. Who you discussed the problem set with. Remember that the solution must be your own, but you can discuss your ideas with others provided you mention that in this file.

All the discussions are within our group, including Xioayue Guo. We also got information and help from piazza posts.

2. What the distribution of work in your team was like. Who did what?

We discussed the project together. Yuhan Wang wrote the CubexParser.g4 and modified the CubexLexer.g4. Yinglei Wang and Feiran Chen helped to check and modify CubexParser.g4. Each of us is responsible for implementing a subset of the classes. Yinglei Wang wrote the main function. Each of us is responsible for writing a subset of the test cases and debugging the project.

3. Any additional comments you might have about the problem set. 

It takes too long to understand the Cubex language and understanding the antler parser rules.
